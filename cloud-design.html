            The design of your cloud is an important first step during the
            transition to a cloud computing system and should never be
            overlooked. At this stage, critical cloud decisions are made –
            decisions which will determine the level of success you achieve for
            your new environment. There are a ton of choices to be made and a
            wide variety of questions that need to be answered before the
            migration process begins. Some of the more important of these are:

          All of these questions are difficult to answer, and it’s important not
          to rush through this part of the process. Getting it right in this

            When searching for the perfect cloud provider, you have to consider
